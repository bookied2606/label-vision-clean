# 📸 Label Scanning Guide - How to Capture Properly

## 🎯 Two-Side Scanning for Complete Data

This app captures **FRONT and BACK** sides separately to get maximum info:
- **FRONT**: Product name, brand, design
- **BACK**: Expiry date, ingredients, warnings ⭐

## ✅ CORRECT WAY (Will work great):

### Capturing FRONT Side:
1. **Position the label**
   - Place the label **flat and straight** in front of camera
   - Make sure it fills most of the frame
   - Text should be **clearly readable**

2. **Lighting** 
   - Use **good natural or artificial light**
   - Avoid harsh shadows or glare
   - Best: soft, even lighting from the side

3. **Focus & Clarity**
   - Hold still for 1 second
   - Make sure text is **sharp and not blurry**
   - Text should look crisp

4. **Tap to Capture**
   - Tap "Tap to Capture" button
   - Wait for green thumbnail to appear ✓

### Capturing BACK Side (Important for Expiry Date!):
1. **FLIP the label** to show the back side
   - Back side usually has: expiry date, ingredients, net weight, barcode

2. **Position **same as front**:
   - Stay **straight and centered**
   - Fill the frame with the back label
   - Ensure text is clearly visible

3. **Same lighting**:
   - Keep same good lighting
   - No shadows on the text
   - Text should be readable to human eye

4. **Tap to Capture**
   - Tap button again to capture back
   - Watch for second green thumbnail ✓

5. **Both captured?** → Auto-uploads to backend! 🚀

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES (Won't work):

**Front Side:**
- ❌ Label at an angle (text distorted)
- ❌ Label too far away (text too small)
- ❌ Blurry image (text not sharp)
- ❌ Failed lighting (text hard to see)
- ❌ Label partially out of frame

**Back Side (WHERE EXPIRY IS!):**
- ❌ Forgot to flip the label
- ❌ Captured front again instead of back
- ❌ Blurry back image
- ❌ Poor lighting on back
- ❌ Expiry date partially out of frame

## 📋 The Blue Frame Guide

The blue square on your screen is where you should position the label:
- **YELLOW ZONE**: Position label to fill this square
- **GREEN ZONE**: What you'll get (make sure readable!)
- **RED ZONE**: Outside = might miss important text

---

## 🎯 Where to Find Expiry Date

Typically found on the **BACK** of labels:
- Bottom right or bottom left
- Near nutritional info
- Often formatted as: `EXP: 12/2025` or `USE BY: JAN 2026`
- Some labels have: `MFG: 06/2024` (manufacturing date)

**Make sure back side text is in the frame!**

## 🔍 Debugging Your Captures

If expiry date is missing:
1. Check if you **captured the BACK** (not front twice)
2. Check if expiry date was **in the camera frame**
3. Check if date was **clearly visible** (readable to human eye)
4. Try again with **better lighting** and **closer distance**

## 💡 Quick Checklist for Perfect Capture:

- [ ] **Front side**: Product name visible? Brand visible? Text clear?
- [ ] **Tap**. See green thumbnail? ✓
- [ ] **Flip to back**: Is it the back? (nut info, expiry, barcode usually here)
- [ ] **Back side**: Expiry date in frame? Text readable? Good lighting?
- [ ] **Tap**. See second thumbnail? ✓
- [ ] **Wait** for upload to complete

✅ Both thumbnails green = Good capture!
❌ Blurry or empty = Try again with better lighting/closer distance
